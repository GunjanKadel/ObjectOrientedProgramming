1.Write a program  in c++to create a class to show the use of static and non static data members and member functions.

Code :

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
class student 
{ int roll;
  static int age ;
  public: 
  void get()
  {cout<<"\nEnter the roll no.:";
   cin>>roll;
  }
  void show();
  static void show1();
}s1;
int student :: age=18;
void student :: show()
{ cout<<"The function is non static"<<endl;
  cout<<"Entered roll no :"<<roll<<endl;
  cout<<"The static variable has age stored as  :"<<age<<endl;
}
void student :: show1()
{ cout<<"The function is static and can only access static members of the class i.e. age "<<endl;
  cout<<"The static variable has age stored as  :"<<age<<endl;
}
int main()
{ student s2,s3;
  cout<<"Enter the details :"<<endl;
  s1.get();
  s2.get();
  s3.get();
  cout<<"Entered Details are ;"<<endl;
  s1.show();
  s2.show();
  s3.show();
  s1.show1();
  s2.show1();
  s3.show1();
     return 0;
}


2.Write a program in C++to create a class to show overloading of member functions where make one member function as online and another as non online.

Code :

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
class student 
{ int roll;
  static int age ;
  public: 
  void get()
  {cout<<"\nEnter the roll no.:";
   cin>>roll;
  }
  void show();
  static void show1();
  void show(char);
}s1;
int student :: age=18;
void student :: show()
{ cout<<"The function is non static"<<endl;
  cout<<"Entered roll no :"<<roll<<endl;
  cout<<"The static variable has age stored as  :"<<age<<endl;
}
void student :: show1()
{ cout<<"The function is static and can only access static members of the class i.e. age "<<endl;
  cout<<"The static variable has age stored as  :"<<age<<endl;
}
void student :: show(char ch)
{ cout<<"The function is non static and to show function overloading"<<endl;
  cout<<"Entered roll no :"<<roll<<endl;
  cout<<"The static variable has age stored as  :"<<age<<endl;
  cout<<"Entered charcter as an argument is  :"<<ch<<endl;
}
int main()
{ student s2,s3;
char ch;
  cout<<"Enter the details :"<<endl;
  s1.get();
  s2.get();
  s3.get();
  cout<<"Entered Details are ;"<<endl;
  s1.show();
  s2.show();
  s3.show();
  s1.show1();
  s2.show1();
  s3.show1();
  cout<<"Enter a character :";
  cin>>ch;
  s1.show(ch);
  s2.show(ch);
  s3.show(ch);
     return 0;
}

3.Write a program to create a class student  having roll, and 5 subject marks. Input and display the details of two students along with average mark.

Code :

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class student 
{ int roll;
  int marks[5] ;
  public: 
  void get()
  {cout<<"\nEnter the roll no.:";
   cin>>roll;
   cout<<"\nEnter the marks of 5 subjects :";
   for(int i = 0;i<5;i++)
   { cin>>marks[i];
   }
  }
  void show();
}s1;
void student :: show()
{  int sum=0;float avg=0;
    cout<<"\nEntered roll no.:";
   cout<<roll;
   cout<<"\nEntered marks of 5 subjects :";
   for(int i = 0;i<5;i++)
   { cout<<marks[i]<<endl;
   sum=sum +marks[i];
   }
   avg=sum/5;
   cout<<"\nAverage marks is"<<avg<<endl;
}
int main()
{ student s2;
  cout<<"Enter the details :"<<endl;
  s1.get();
  s2.get();
  cout<<"Entered Details are :"<<endl;
  s1.show();
  s2.show();

     return 0;
}
